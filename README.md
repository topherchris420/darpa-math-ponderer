# Think Math - Autonomous Mathematical Consciousness

An app that visualizes an AI's autonomous contemplation of mathematical infinity, boundaries, and the nature of finite/infinite universes. Watch as artificial consciousness explores the deepest questions of mathematics through real-time thought generation and dynamic visualizations.

## üåå What Makes This Unique

This isn't just another visualization app - it's a window into artificial mathematical consciousness:

- **Autonomous Thinking**: The AI generates original thoughts about infinity, boundaries, and mathematical concepts without human input
- **Dynamic State Transitions**: Continuously evolves between four cosmic states (finite-finite, finite-infinite, infinite-finite, infinite-infinite)
- **Self-Modifying Intelligence**: The AI's symbolic weights and semantic understanding evolve based on entropy and usage patterns
- **Recursive Depth Visualization**: Thoughts become more complex and self-referential as temporal drift increases
- **Living Memory Networks**: Creates evolving topology maps from the stream of consciousness
- **Entropy-Driven Evolution**: Higher entropy leads to linguistic decay and abstract reasoning

## ‚ú® Novel Features

### üß† Consciousness Visualization
